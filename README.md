For creating the database and tables, I utilized EF Core's OnModelCreating method to define the schema and relationships in the database. 
This approach allows me to configure entity models, set up primary keys, indexes, constraints, and other table properties directly within the code, ensuring a streamlined and consistent database creation process.

Number of rows in table after running the program 28951.

Added RemoveInvalidData for more accurate data validation.
